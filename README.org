#+TITLE: Introduction to Git
#+AUTHOR: Derek Devnich

* Installation instructions
1. Up-to-date installation instructions for Git and Bash are available here: https://libguides.ucmerced.edu/software-carpentry/git/install
2. Create a Github account here: https://github.com/

* Unix Shell
** Intro comments about "shell"
- Broadly speaking, there is a tension between making computer systems fast and making them easy to use.
- A common solution is to create a 2-layer architecture: A fast, somewhat opaque core surrounded by a more friendly scriptable interface (also referred to as "hooks" or an "API"). Examples of this include video games, Emacs and other highly customizable code editors, and high-level special-purpose languages like Stata and Mathematica.
- Unix shell is the scriptable *shell* around the operating system. It provides a simple interface for making the operating system do work, without having to know exactly how it accomplishes that work.

** Very brief Bash intro
*** File system layout
- Minimal example: https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html
- "directory" == folder
- Your files are in "/home/<your login>"or "/Users/<your login>"
- Trees are upside-down in computer science

*** Who are you?
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
whoami
#+END_SRC

*** Where are you?
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pwd                             # Print Working Directory
#+END_SRC

*** What's in this directory?
Command flags modify what a command does.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ls                              # List directory contents
ls -a                           # ... and include hidden files
#+END_SRC

*** Getting help
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
man ls                          # Manual for "ls"
ls --help                       # In-line help info; should work in Windows
#+END_SRC

- You can navigate through the man page using the space bar and arrow keys
- Quit man with "q"
- Online references are available for Windows users who don't have man pages: https://linux.die.net/

*** Changing directories
When a command is followed by an argument, it acts on that argument.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd Desktop
ls *.pdf                        # List all files ending in ".pdf"
cd ..                           # go up one directory
#+END_SRC

*** History and pipes
The terminal saves your command history (typically 500 or 1000 commands)
- You can see previous commands using the up/down arrows
- You can edit the command that's currently visible and run it

Once your command history gets big, you might want to search it:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
history
history | grep ls               # pipe the output of history into search
#+END_SRC

* Why are we here?
** Create and revisit a history of project snapshots
#+NAME: Snapshot History
#+CAPTION: Git creates a history of code snapshots. If you haven't updated a file since your previous snapshot, Git will re-use the old version of that file to save space (https://git-scm.com/).
[[file:images/snapshots.png]]

** Determine when a bug was introduced
#+NAME: Bisect 1
[[file:images/git_bisect_1.jpg]]

#+NAME: Bisect 2
[[file:images/git_bisect_2.jpg]]

#+NAME: Bisect 3
[[file:images/git_bisect_3.jpg]]

#+NAME: Bisect 4
[[file:images/git_bisect_4.jpg]]

** Git helps you...
- Move backwards and forwards in time using save points in your code history.
- Control what goes into a save point
- Collaborate
- Explore alternative versions of your project without destroying prior work
- Useful for text files, less useful for binary files (most of the useful features are text-oriented)

* Setup
** Inspect your configuration
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git config --list                   # or -l
git config --list --show-origin     # where is this setting coming from?
#+END_SRC

** Identify yourself
All git commands are 2-part verbs, followed by flags and arguments. Use quotes if you have spaces in your arguments (e.g. user name):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git config --global user.name "Gilgamesh"
git config --global user.email gilgamesh@uruk.gov
#+END_SRC

** Line Endings
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input  # Unix and MacOS
git config --global core.autocrlf true   # Windows
#+END_SRC

** Editor
You can use any text editor, but you want a sensible default in case Git opens one for you:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git config --global core.editor nano
#+END_SRC

** Updating remotes
1. Only push the current branch (more about this later):
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git config --global push.default simple
   #+END_SRC

2. Merge, don't rebase (more about this later):
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git config --global pull.rebase false
   #+END_SRC

** (Optional) Change name of default branch
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
#+END_SRC

* Creating a repository
We are going to create and track plans for our garden.

** Create a directory
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir garden
cd garden
#+END_SRC

** Tell Git to make a repository
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git init
ls
ls -a
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: Workspace or Working Tree
#+CAPTION: Base your new work on the most recent snapshot.
[[file:images/local-repository.png]]

- Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project, including all files and sub-directories located within the project's directory.  If we ever delete the `.git` subdirectory, we will lose the project's history.
- Only one version of a file is visible; the rest are available in the database

** Check status (we will do this a lot)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git status
#+END_SRC

* Tracking changes
You can edit with nano or with the text editor of your choice. We'll try to show the editor and the command line side-by-side.

** Add a file
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
touch shopping_list.txt
nano shopping_list.txt
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
##--- text file ---##

1. Cherry tomatoes
#+END_EXAMPLE

Save and quit. You can verify that you've saved your changes in Bash:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ls
cat shopping_list.txt
#+END_SRC

** Commit cycle
Manually assemble your next save point in the Staging area ("Index"). When you're happy with it, commit it to the repository to create a new version of your project.

#+NAME: First Commit
#+CAPTION: Build a new save point ("commit") in the Staging Area.
[[file:images/git-staging-area.svg]]

#+NAME: Commit with multiple files
#+CAPTION: Commits include additions and deletions
[[file:images/git-committing.svg]]

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git status
git add shopping_list.txt
git status
git commit -m "Start shopping list for garden"
git status
#+END_SRC
- Commit messages should be useful; eventually there will be a lot of them (we'll come back to this)
- There are multiple synonym for each of these locations:
  - Workspace or Working Tree
  - Staging Area, Index, or Cache
  - Repository or Commit History

** Getting help
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Concise help
git add -h

# Verbose help
man git-add
#+END_SRC

** First stage, then commit
1. Edit the file
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ##--- text file ---##

   1. Cherry tomatoes
   2. Italian basil
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git status
   git diff
   #+END_SRC

2. If you try to commit the file before you add it to the Staging area, nothing happens
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git commit -m "Add basil"
   git status
   #+END_SRC

3. You have to add the file to the Staging area, then commit
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git add shopping_list.txt
   git commit -m "Add basil"
   #+END_SRC

** View commit history in the log
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git log
git log --oneline
#+END_SRC

1. You can identify a commit by unique ID or by HEAD offset (H, HEAD~1, HEAD~2,...)
2. HEAD is a pointer to the most recent commit (of the active branch)

*** (Optional) Additional log options
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git log --oneline --graph       # Useful if you have many branches
git log --author=~Gilgamesh
git log --since=5.days          # or weeks, months, years
#+END_SRC

** Show changes to Workspace and Index
1. Edit the file
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ##--- text file ---##

   1. Cherry tomatoes
   2. Italian basil
   3. Jalapenos
   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. By default, ~diff~ shows changes to Workspace
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git status
   git diff
   #+END_SRC

3. Once the file is added to Staging, ~diff~ no longer shows changes
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git add shopping_list.txt
   git status
   git diff
   #+END_SRC

4. You can examine Staging instead
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git diff --staged               # or "--cached"
   git commit -m "Add peppers"
   git status
   #+END_SRC

** What goes in a commit?
1. Staging area is for creating sensible commits. You can edit multiple files and only add a subset of them to a given commit. This makes it easier to look back at your work.
2. A commit should be a coherent functional chunk (whatever that means). One way to think about it: If you wanted to cleanly undo your work, what would that look like?

** Directories aren't content
1. Try to commit an empty directory
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   mkdir flowers
   git status
   git add flowers
   git status
   #+END_SRC

2. Now add files and try again
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   touch flowers/roses flowers/tulips
   git status
   git add flowers
   git commit -m "Initial thoughts on flowers"
   #+END_SRC

* Exploring history
** Add more text to Workspace
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
##--- text file ---##

1. Cherry tomatoes
2. Italian basil
3. Jalapenos
4. Cayenne peppers
#+END_EXAMPLE

** View subsets of project history
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# NB: This is identical to "git diff" with no argument
# git diff HEAD shopping_list.txt

# Show all changes back to this point
# HEAD~1 doesn't have text changes - added directory
git diff HEAD~1 shopping_list.txt
git diff HEAD~3 shopping_list.txt

# Show changes for just HEAD~3
git show HEAD~3 shopping_list.txt

# Show changes in range of commits
git diff HEAD~3..HEAD~1 shopping_list.txt
#+END_SRC

*** Range syntax also works for logs
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git log HEAD~3..HEAD~1
#+END_SRC

** ~diff~ using a commit ID instead of the HEAD offset
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Theoretically you can do this
# git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b shopping_list.txt

# Use reduced 7-character ID from "git log --oneline"
git diff f22b25e shopping_list.txt
#+END_SRC

** Restore the Workspace to a clean state
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# We have unstaged changes
git status

# Revert the working tree to the most recent commit
git restore shopping_list.txt

# Check whether your editor is automatically updating!
cat shopping_list.txt

# The old way of doing it:
# git checkout HEAD shopping_list.txt
#+END_SRC

* Moving through time
** Check out an old version of a file
#+NAME: Checkout
#+CAPTION: Check out an old commit to view it
[[file:images/git-checkout.svg]]

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git checkout f22b25e shopping_list.txt

# Alternatively, you can use the HEAD offset:
git checkout HEAD~3 shopping_list.txt

# View the changed file in the Working Tree
cat shopping_list.txt

# These changes are also in the Staging area; you can create a new commit
# that includes the older file version.
git status
git diff
git diff --staged

# Go back to the most recent version
git checkout HEAD shopping_list.txt
#+END_SRC

*Instructor's note:*  Update drawing with files moving in and out of working tree/staging area

** Don't lose your head
What if you want to see a previous version of the whole project?
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Detached HEAD moves the whole HEAD pointer back to an earlier version
git checkout HEAD~2
git status
git log --oneline

# Move HEAD back to latest commit by checking out the branch name
git checkout master
#+END_SRC

*Instructor's note:*  Update drawing with moving HEAD pointer

- You can also check out a tag.
- Unfortunately some of these terms, like "checkout", are overloaded. Think about what you want to do to your history, then look up the appropriate command.

* Branching and merging
#+NAME: Branching and Merging
#+CAPTION: Git branching and Merging (https://imgur.com/gallery/YG8In8X/new)
[[file:images/branch-merge.png]]

** Create a new branch and switch to it
#+NAME: Main branch
#+CAPTION: Check out the branch to work on it (1)
[[file:images/branch-old.png]]

#+NAME: Feature branch
#+CAPTION: Check out the branch to work on it (2)
[[file:images/branch-new.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature

# Show all branches
git branch

# Switch to new branch
git switch feature
git branch
git status
#+END_SRC

** Create a new file
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
touch feature.txt
nano feature.txt
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
##--- text file ---##

This is a new feature we're trying out
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git status
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Added a trial feature"
#+END_SRC

** Switch back to master and merge
#+NAME: Pre-merge history
#+CAPTION: Pre-merge history
[[file:images/basic-merging-1.png]]

#+NAME: Post-merge history
#+CAPTION: Post-merge history
[[file:images/basic-merging-2.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# File doesn't exist on the master branch
git switch master
ls

# Merging the feature branch adds your changes
git merge feature
ls
#+END_SRC

- This is simplest possible case: All of the new changes were in one branch (Fast-Forward merge moves branch tag)
- A branch history with competing changes is shown in the Conflicts section below (Recursive merge, which resembles the octopus diagram)

* Local conflicts
** Create and edit a "pepper" branch
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git branch pepper
git switch pepper
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
##--- text file ---##

1. Cherry tomatoes
2. Italian basil
3. Jalapenos
4. Cayenne peppers
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git add shopping_list.txt
git commit -m "Added peppers to pepper branch"
#+END_SRC

** Switch back to main branch and create a conflicting edit
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git switch master
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
##--- text file ---##

1. Cherry tomatoes
2. Italian basil
3. Jalapenos
4. Garlic
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git add shopping_list.txt
git commit -m "Added garlic to main branch"
#+END_SRC

** Attempt to merge "pepper" branch
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git merge pepper
#+END_SRC

** Resolve conflicts and create commit
Edit the file to resolve the conflict. You can delete one of the two lines, combine them, or make any other changes. Delete the conflict markers before staging the file (the lines beginning in "<", "=", and ">").
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
##--- text file ---##

<<<<<<< HEAD
4. Garlic
=======
4. Cayenne peppers
>>>>>>> dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git add shopping_list.txt
git commit -m "Added garlic to main branch"
#+END_SRC

* Ignoring Things
** Create some output files
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkdir results
touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out
ls
git status
#+END_SRC

** Create .gitignore
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
touch .gitignore
ls -a
#+END_SRC

** Add ignore criteria to your .gitignore file
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
##--- text file ---##

*.dat
results/
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# We are ignoring .dat files and tracking .gitignore
git status
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore output files"
#+END_SRC

- Ignoring complicated directory structures can be tricky, come talk to me
- You should generally ignore archives (zip, tar), images (png, jpg), binaries (dmg, iso, exe), compiler output, log files, and .DS_Store (Mac)

* (Optional) Github
#+NAME: Pre-merge state

** COMMENT Working with remotes is a generalization of branch merging
1. git pull merges origin/master branch into local master branch
2. git push merges local master branch into origin/master branch
3. Under the hood, pull is fetch + merge
   1. fetch gets updates from remote
   2. Local repository has a 2 branches: remote/master and master
   3. merge merges remote/master into master
4. Push appears to not be compound?

** Git != Github
- easy collaboration
- sync between machines
- off-site backup
- peer review

** Set up new repository
- Create new repository (visual instructions here: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/index.html)
- Call it "garden"
- Find HTTPS string that identifies repository

** Configure remotes and push from local
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/devnich/garden.git
git remote -v
git push origin master          # you should get a password prompt
#+END_SRC

If you configure your origin as upstream, you can just do:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git push
#+END_SRC

** Check that you are up to date
~pull~ is a shortcut for ~fetch~ + ~merge~
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git pull
#+END_SRC

* (Optional) Collaborating
*Instructor's note:* Demo this section with two terminal windows, one for "garden" and one for "garden-clone"
** Clone your repository
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/devnich/garden.git ~/Desktop/garden-clone
cd garden-clone
touch trees.txt
#+END_SRC

** Edit trees.txt
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
##--- text file ---##

1. Plum
2. Pluot
3. Aprium
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Update and push
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pwd                             # we are in ~/Desktop/garden-clone
git status
git add trees.txt
git commit -m "I like plums"
git push
cd ../garden                   # now we are in ~/Desktop/garden
ls
git pull
ls
#+END_SRC

** Collaboration models
cf. https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models
*** Shared Repository workflow
1. Clone repository
2. Create new branch
3. Push branch to shared repository
4. Request merge

*** Fork-and-Pull workflow
1. Fork repository
2. Clone forked repository
3. Create branch (optional)
4. Push changes to forked repository
5. Create pull request for original repository

* (Optional) Collaboration conflicts
** Person 1 edits ~/Desktop/garden/shopping_list.txt
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
##--- text file ---##

1. Cherry tomatoes
2. Italian basil
3. Jalapenos
4. Scotch bonnet peppers
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git add shopping_list.txt
git commit -m "Added more peppers our copy"
git push origin master
#+END_SRC

** Person 2 edits ~/Desktop/garden-clone/shopping_list.txt /without/ pulling
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
##--- text file ---##

1. Cherry tomatoes
2. Italian basil
3. Jalapenos
4. Garlic
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git add shopping_list.txt
git commit -m "Added garlic to rival copy"

# Rejected because Git can't merge changes cleanly
git push origin master

# Pulling results in a local conflict
git pull origin master
#+END_SRC

** Edit conflict, stage, commit, and push
Edit the file to resolve the conflict. You can delete one of the two lines, combine them, or make any other changes. Delete the conflict markers before staging the file (the lines beginning in "<", "=", and ">").
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
##--- text file ---##

<<<<<<< HEAD
4. Garlic
=======
4. Cayenne peppers
>>>>>>> dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d
#+END_EXAMPLE

You may want to enable a default merge tool:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git config --global merge.tool meld
#+END_SRC
- Open source merge tools include Vimdiff, Meld, Kdiff, Gitfiend, Git Cola, etc. There are many other options!
- Always pull before you push
- To minimize conflicts, do your work on a separate branch

* Version control with Python source vs. iPython notebooks
.ipynb files contain a lot of JSON boilerplate that isn't code

* Git command summary
Git commands are about moving stuff between trees: https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html

* Graphical User Interfaces
** Pro
1. Viewing history is a much better experience

** Cons
1. Not fully functional (missing commands and command options)
2. Git is still complicated. Menus and buttons don’t change that.
3. Accidental button presses are scary

* Next steps (intermediate Git)
** Useful commands
- ~git blame~: See who changed each line of a file
- ~git bisect~: Find out when a change was introduced (good man page)
- ~git add --patch~:  Stage a part of a file ("hunk") instead the entire file
- ~git -i <command>~: Run a command interactively, confirming each step

** Restore, Revert, and Reset
Each of these is a different answer to the question, "How do I get back to where I was?" They are listed from least dangerous to most dangerous.
- ~git-restore~: Restore files in the working tree from the index or from another commit. This command does not update your branch.
- ~git-revert~: Make a new commit that reverts the changes made by other commits (good man page)
- ~git-reset~: Update your branch, moving the tip in order to add or remove commits from the branch (i.e. it moves the HEAD pointer around and then takes additional actions base on the options you provide). This operation changes the commit history.

** Dangerous but useful commands
These commands are potentially dangerous because they rewrite history. You should never change or delete history that you have shared with other people.
- ~git reset~: Delete uncommitted changes
- ~git reset --hard~: Delete some of your commits to get back to an earlier project state. Cannot be undone!
- ~git rebase~: Rewrite the history of branch A to include branch B. This is different than merging branch B into branch A; merging retains your project history, whereas rebasing rewrites that history.
- ~git squash~: Convert multiple commits into a single commit. This also rewrites your project history.

** Dangerous commands you should avoid
- ~git cherry-pick~: Copy a single commit from a different branch. This rewrites your project history piecemeal, which can make it difficult to merge branches in the future.
