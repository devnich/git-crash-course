* Installation instructions
You should (try to) install Bash and Git prior to the lesson:
    1. Create a Github account on https://github.com/
    2. Install Bash (if not already installed)
    3. Install Git (if not already installed)

** Instructions for Mac users:

Bash will already be installed. To see if Git is installed, open the Terminal application (found in /Applications/Utilities) and type the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git --version
#+END_SRC

If you see a message like "git version 2.20.1" (for example), Git is installed. If you get an error message, you will need to install the XCode command line tools. More recent versions of MacOS will automatically offer to install it for you; if you get a popup window prompting you to install the Xcode command line tools, agree to all of the prompts. Otherwise, type the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
xcode-select --install
#+END_SRC

** Instructions for Windows users:
    1. Download the Git for Windows installer: https://gitforwindows.org/
    2. Run the installer and follow the steps below:
       1. Click on "Next" four times (two times if you've previously installed Git). You don't need to change anything in the Information, location, components, and start menu screens.
       2. Select "Use the nano editor by default" and click on "Next".
       3. Keep "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" selected and click on "Next". If you forgot to do this programs that you need for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the installer and select the appropriate option.
       4. Click on "Next".
       5. Select "Use the native Windows Secure Channel library", and click "Next".
       6. Keep "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" selected and click on "Next".
       7. Select "Use Windows' default console window" and click on "Next".
       8. Leave all three items selected, and click on "Next".
       9. Do not select the experimental option. Click "Install".
       10. Click on "Finish".
    3. If your "HOME" environment variable is not set (or you don't know what this is):
       1. Open command prompt (Open Start Menu then type "cmd" and press Enter)
       2. Type the following line into the command prompt window exactly as shown:
          #+BEGIN_SRC bash
          setx HOME "%USERPROFILE%"
          #+END_SRC
          Press Enter, you should see "SUCCESS: Specified value was saved."
          Quit command prompt by typing "exit" then pressing Enter

This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.

* Unix Shell
** Intro comments about "shell"
- Broadly speaking, there is a tension between making computer systems fast and making them easy to use.
- A common solution is to create a 2-layer architecture: A fast, somewhat opaque, core, surrounded by a more friendly scriptable interface (also referred to as an "API" or "hooks"). Examples of this include video games, Emacs and other highly customizable code editors, and high-level special-purpose languages like Stata and Mathematica.
- Unix shell is the scriptable *shell* around the operating system. It provides a simple interface for making the operating system do work, without having to know exactly how it accomplishes it.

** Very brief Bash intro
*** File system layout
- Minimal example: https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html
- "directory" == folder
- Your files are in "/home/<your login>"or "/Users/<your login>"
- Trees are upside-down in computer science

*** Is it working?
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
whoami
#+END_SRC

*** Where are we?
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pwd                             # Print Working Directory
#+END_SRC

*** What's in this directory?
Command flags modify what a command does.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ls                              # List directory contents
ls -a                           # ... and include hidden files
#+END_SRC

*** Getting help
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
man ls                          # Modal help page
ls --help                       # In-line help info; should work in Windows
#+END_SRC
- You can navigate through the man page using the space bar and arrow keys
- Quit man with "q"
- Online references are available for Windows users who don't have man pages: https://linux.die.net/

*** Changing directories
When a command is followed by an argument, it acts on that argument.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd Desktop
ls *.pdf                        # List all files ending in ".pdf"
cd ..                           # go up one directory
#+END_SRC

*** History and pipes
The terminal saves your command history (typically 500 or 1000 commands)
- You can see previous commands using the up/down arrows
- You can edit the command that's currently visible and run it

Once your command history gets big, you might want to search it:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
history
history | grep ls               # pipe the output of history into search
#+END_SRC

* Git
** Why are we here?
#+CAPTION: Git create snapshots of your code. If you haven't updated a file since your previous snapshot, Git will re-use the old version of that file to save space (https://git-scm.com/).
#+NAME: fig:Snapshot History
[[file:snapshots.png]]
- Move backwards and forwards in time via snapshots
- Control what goes into a snapshot
- Collaborate
- Explore alternative versions
- Useful for text files, less useful for binary files (most of the useful features are text-oriented)

** Setup
*** Identify yourself
All git commands are 2-part verbs, followed by flags and arguments:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git config --global user.name "Gilgamesh"
git config --global user.email "gilgamesh@uruk.gov"
#+END_SRC

*** Line Endings
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input  # Unix
git config --global core.autocrlf true   # Windows
#+END_SRC

*** Editor
You can use any text editor, but you want a sensible default in case Git pops one up:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git config --global core.editor "nano -w"
#+END_SRC

*** Updating remotes
Only push the current branch (more about this later):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git config --global push.default = "simple"
#+END_SRC

*** Inspect your configuration
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git config --list                   # or -l
#+END_SRC

** Creating a repository
We will continue with the story of Wolfman and Dracula who are investigating if it is possible to send a planetary lander to Mars.

*** Create a directory
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir planets
cd planets
#+END_SRC

*** Tell Git to make a repository
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git init
ls
ls -a
#+END_SRC
Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project, including all files and sub-directories located within the project's directory.  If we ever delete the `.git` subdirectory, we will lose the project's history.

*** Check status (we will do this a lot)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git status
#+END_SRC

** Tracking changes
*** Add a file
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
touch mars.txt
nano mars.txt
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
#+END_EXAMPLE

Save and quit. You can verify that you've saved your changes in Bash:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ls
cat mars.txt
#+END_SRC

*** Commit cycle
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git status
git add mars.txt
git status
git commit -m "Start notes on Mars as a base"
git status
#+END_SRC
- Commit messages should be useful; eventually there will be a lot of them (we'll come back to this)
*Draw* working tree, staging area, and repository commit (no history yet)

*** Add more history
Edit with editor of your choice:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git status
git diff

# If you try to commit the file before you add it to the Staging area,
# nothing happens:
git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
git status

# Add file to Staging area, then commit:
git add mars.txt
git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
#+END_SRC
*Update drawing* with repository history going back in time (H, H~1, H~2...)

*** Add more history; look at Staging area vs Workspace
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# By default, "diff" shows changes to Workspace
git status
git diff

# Once the file is added to Staging, "diff" no longer shows changes
git add mars.txt
git status
git diff

# You can examine Staging instead
git diff --staged
git commit -m "Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy"
git status
#+END_SRC
- Staging area is for creating sensible commits. You can edit multiple files and only add a subset of them to a given commit. This makes it easier to look back at your work.

*** View commit history in the log
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git log
git log --oneline
git log --oneline --graph
#+END_SRC
- You can identify commit by unique ID or by HEAD offset
- HEAD is a pointer to the most recent commit

*** Directories aren't content
Try to commit an empty directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkdir spaceships
git status
git add spaceships
git status
#+END_SRC

Now add files and try again:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
touch spaceships/apollo11 spaceships/sputnik
git status
ls spaceships
git add spaceships
git commit -m "Initial thoughts on spaceships"
#+END_SRC

** Exploring history
*** Add more text to Workspace
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
An ill-considered change
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Inspect our changes
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cat mars.txt

# Identical to "git diff" with no argument
git diff HEAD mars.txt

# Show all changes back to this point
git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
git diff HEAD~3 mars.txt

# Show changes for just HEAD~3
git show HEAD~3 mars.txt

# SHow changes in range of commits
git diff HEAD~3..HEAD~1 mars.txt
#+END_SRC

*** Range syntax also works for logs
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git log HEAD~3..HEAD~1
#+END_SRC

*** Using unique ID instead of HEAD offset
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt

# Use reduced ID from "git log --oneline"
git diff f22b25e mars.txt
#+END_SRC

*** Restore the Workspace to a clean state
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git status                      # We have unstaged changes

# Revert the working tree to the most recent commit
git checkout HEAD mars.txt
cat mars.txt
#+END_SRC

** Moving through time
*** Checkout old version of a file
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git checkout f22b25e mars.txt   # or "git checkout HEAD~3 mars.txt"
cat mars.txt

# These changes are also in the Staging area; do a commit if you want to keep
# this older version
git status
git checkout HEAD mars.txt      # get back the new version
#+END_SRC
*Update drawing* with files moving in and out of working tree/staging area

*** Don't lose your head
What if you want to see a previous version of the whole project?
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Detached HEAD moves the whole HEAD pointer back to an earlier version
git checkout HEAD~2
git status

# Move HEAD back to latest commit by checking out the branch name
git checkout master
#+END_SRC
- Unfortunately some of these terms, like "checkout", are overloaded. Think about what you want to do to your history, then look up the appropriate command.
*Update drawing* with moving HEAD pointer

** Branching and merging
#+CAPTION: Git branching and Merging (https://imgur.com/gallery/YG8In8X/new)
#+NAME: fig:Branching and Merging
[[file:YG8In8X.png]]

*** Create a new branch and switch to it
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git checkout -b feature
git branch                      # Show all branches
git status
#+END_SRC

*** Create a new file
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
touch feature.txt
nano feature.txt
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
This is a new feature we're trying out
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git add feature.txt
  git commit -m "Added a trial feature"
  ls                              # We have a new file
#+END_SRC

*** Switch back to master and merge
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git checkout master
  ls                              # File doesn't exist on the master branch
  git merge feature
  ls                              # Merging the feature branch adds your changes
#+END_SRC
- This is simplest possible case; all of the new changes were in one branch
*Draw* the branch history with the merge (Fast-Forward merge moves branch tag)
*Draw* a branch history with competing changes (Recursive merge resembles octopus graph)

** Ignoring Things
*** Create some output files
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkdir results
touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out
ls
git status
#+END_SRC

*** Create .gitignore
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
touch .gitignore
ls -a
#+END_SRC

*** Ignore some files
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*.dat
results/
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# We are ignoreing .dat files and tracking .gitignore
git status
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore output files"
#+END_SRC
- Ignoring complicated directory structures can be tricky, come talk to me
- You should generally ignore archives (zip, tar), images (png, jpg), binaries (dmg, iso, exe), compiler output, log files, and .DS_Store (Mac)

** Github
*** Git != Github
- easy collaboration
- sync between machines
- off-site backup

*** Set up new repository
- Create new repository (visual instructions here: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/index.html)
- Call it "planets"
- Find HTTPS string that identifies repository

*** Configure remotes and push from local
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/devnich/planets.git
git remote -v
git push origin master          # you should get a password prompt
#+END_SRC
If you configure your origin as upstream, you can just do:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git push
#+END_SRC

*** Check that you are up to date
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git pull
#+END_SRC

** Collaborating
*** Clone your repository
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/devnich/planets.git ~/Desktop/planets-clone
cd planets-clone
touch pluto.txt
#+END_SRC

*** Edit pluto.txt
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
It is so a planet!
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Update and push
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pwd                             # we are in ~/Desktop/planets-clone
git status
git add pluto.txt
git commit -m "I have feelings about Pluto"
git push
cd ../planets                   # now we are in ~/Desktop/planets
ls
git pull
ls
#+END_SRC

** Conflicts
*** Person 1 edits ~/Desktop/planets/mars.txt
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
This line added to original "planets" repo
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git add mars.txt
git commit -m "Add a line in our copy"
git push origin master
#+END_SRC

*** Person 2 edits ~/Desktop/planets-clone/mars.txt /without/ pulling
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
This line added to separate "planets-clone" repo
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git add mars.txt
git commit -m "Add a line in rival copy"

# Rejected because Git can't merge changes cleanly
git push origin master

# Pulling results in a local conflict
git pull origin master
#+END_SRC

*** Edit conflict, commit, and push
- Always pull before you push

** Version control with source vs. notebooks
- .ipynb files contain a lot of JSON boilerplate that isn't code
